    <h3>The report:</h3>
    <p>At first I thought the HTML & CSS programming language was very, very simple, but it's not as simple as I
      thought. You can do very complicated things with it. I realised that this programming language provides the base
      for other languages such as JavaScript. Chris's decision to start with this language was very good. From a design
      point of view I tried to combine the colours in such a way that they matched each other. Elements are placed on
      the page with a purpose, to provide a user friendly experience.</p>
    <p>I had a few moments of ups and downs, one of them was the hamburger button, Chris's explanation of making the
      button from scratch via css code seemed much harder, I opted to take the icon code from the web and use that code
      in rendering the icon. </p>
    One good thing about this programming language especially html is that it is very forgiving, it lets you make
    mistakes and that is sometimes a good thing, it is less frustrating. And CSS is a very straight-forward language,
    the coding process is light. In conclusion I think that this language is a very good one to start with, with this
    language you can build the foundations of your career.
    <p>I started the project on 1 April and finished it on 17 April. It took me a lot longer than I anticipated, but in
      the end I managed to get it to the end, it probably took me longer because I underestimated this programming
      language, but I will never underestimate a programming language again.</p>
    <h4>A reflective discussion of your module experience: </h4>
    <p>Overall my experience with this module was wonderful, the explanations given by Chris were more than enough,
      whenever I didn't understand something and asked for it to be explained, Chris helped me. I could ask Chris
      anything in emails about the module, and he every time answered quickly. If it wasn't Chris I don't think I could
      have learned as quickly.</p>
